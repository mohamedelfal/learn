## Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.
## Headings
To create a heading, add one to six `#` symbols before your heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents which you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.
